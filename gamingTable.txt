Game Table
--------------

Overall principles for v1 -
No enforced 'rules'
No 'turns'
Should be fully physical
**What level of mouse compatibility for each game? that is a direct impact on level of effort**

Table
1) Entity spawner
    - Creates x number of a given entity
    - Can either pile (ordered/random) or spread evenly (ordered/random), or create at specific grid locations
2) Mat
    - Changable picture
    - Resizable square grid
    - Snap to grid
3) Seat Spawner
    - Makes a new chair if one is needed
4) Celebrator  [stretch]
    - Particle system above table
    - Triggered by... (?)

Table buttons
- Reset Game
- Next Game [game name]
- New Chair


Difficulty: Low 
(issues: physics will need tuning for things settling.  puzzle may need snapping. )
Puzzles
Dominoes


Difficulty: Medium 
(issues: how to reach in and move a piece without messing up all the other ones.  dice will need something to keep them on the table and 'shake' from a distance w/o flying away)
Chess
Checkers
Dice

Difficulty: High
(issues: seeing other peoples cards.  i need 3d model overlays to be able to be children. mechanic to select cards)
Deck of cards + Betting Chips
